```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy(

## Organising your work with folders!

Folders can be created to keep the main Rproject working directory organised and tidy:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dir.create("scripts")
dir.create("plots")
dir.create("data")
dir.create("markdown")
```

<br>
Under this folder structure:

+ A markdown script would be located in the "markdown" folder
+ A data file (eg. .csv, .pzfx) would located in the "data" folder
+ Relative to the the markdown script, a file pathway to the .csv file would be:
../data/example.csv
